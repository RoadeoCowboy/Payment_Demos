Braintree training session

Drop-in UI vs. Custom Fields vs. Hosted Fields

- Drop-in UI doesnt allow any customizations.
- Least risk for merchant to implement, all fields are Braintree approved.

- Custom Fields allow for full customizations.
- High risk for merchant as these fields are not vetted by Braintree beforehand.

- Hosted Fields are a compromise between Drop-in and Custom.
- Low risk for merchant to implement as all fields are sent to Braintree.
- Allows merchant to collect credit card information.
- Used when the merchant wants a unified look and feel for the payment method page.
- Alternative would be a drop in UI for credit card info and a standard HTML form. - Does not have the same look and feel.

Functionality on the backend can be represented in the frontend, through css styling
- if cursor is on the next selected field, highlight.
